Mars is a great chocolate bar.
In Canada it has a different name.
The planet Mars is a bit different.
No chocolate.
But is there water?
That would be a start. 

Water is needed to grow cocoa plants.
Unless they can be mutated and genetically engineered not to need it.
Some strange tasting chocolate.
Can chocolate be chocolate under any other name?

If any wolfmen or mummies come to Mars, we would need to figure out a way to market to them.
